# ASL-Alphabet Image Classification

This repository contains approaches to classify letter/alphabet images that contain gestures of the American Sign Language (ASL). Deep Learning models are used with Keras, including CNNs defined from scratch, ResNet50 with fine tuning and autoencoders in combination with logistic regression for interpretability.

The original dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: [asl-alphabet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet).
